## Hi there 👋

👩🏻‍💻 I am a PHP wizard, weaving my magic with PHP, Laravel, MySQL, GIT, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, creating RESTful API spells, casting unit and integration tests and following design incantations (KISS, DRY, etc.) to craft powerful software.

🔭 I am currently conjuring up an online banking system built with Laravel, complete with spellbinding features such as account management, internal and external transfers, currency exchange, statement history and filtering, and even the ability to buy, sell, shortlist, and manage your cryptocurrency portfolio like a true financial wizard.

🌱 I am expanding my skillset by learning Vue.js, which will allow me to create magic not only on the back-end but also on the front-end of my projects.

⚡ Fun fact: 
🔐 I am also a Data Protection Expert passionate about technology advancement and privacy compliance.
I understand that when it comes to software development, data protection is the key that unlocks the door to secure information and prevents unwanted access. I am a master locksmith in progress, constantly honing my skills to ensure that every software I craft is not only functional but also fortified with the necessary data security measures.
